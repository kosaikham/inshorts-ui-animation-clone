# Inshorts App UI Animation Clone

It only includes the swipeIn / swipeOut (up and down) animation of Inshorts mobile app. This is one of my practicing repo to improve layout position and animation in React Native.

## Built With

- [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) - a JavaScript framework for writing real, natively rendering mobile applications for iOS and Android
- [Expo](https://expo.io/)[Tools] - It allows you to start a project without installing or configuring any tools to build native code - no Xcode or Android Studio installation required
